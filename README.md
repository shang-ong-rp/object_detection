Object Detection with YOLOv5.

E-Commerce Dataset - (Object Detection on Custom Dataset with YOLO (v5) using PyTorch and Python)[https://curiousily.com/posts/object-detection-on-custom-dataset-with-yolo-v5-using-pytorch-and-python/]

- Unfortunately the (E-Commerce dataset)[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataturks/clothing-item-detection-for-ecommerce] was no-longer avaliable to test it out
- But the (explainer tutorial)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsxDrEJTgRw] was excellent and (CoLab Notebook)[https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e4zvS6LyhOAayEDh3bz8MXFTJcVFSvZX?usp=sharing] was good for use
